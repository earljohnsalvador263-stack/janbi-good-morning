  <h1>Good Morning, My Janbi 🌸</h1>
  <div class="subtitle">A little reminder of how deeply I love you</div>

  <p>
    Good morning, my love. I hope this message finds you with a soft smile on your face
    and a peaceful heart. Before the world asks anything from you today, I just want
    you to remember one thing — you are deeply loved, endlessly appreciated, and incredibly special.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every morning I wake up thankful that someone as kind, sweet, and beautiful as you
    exists in my life. You have this gentle way of making everything feel lighter,
    warmer, and more meaningful just by being you.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <p>
      Janbi, you are hardworking yet easygoing, strong yet soft, and responsible even
      at such a young age. You carry so much on your shoulders, but you still manage
      to smile, care for others, and spread positivity wherever you go.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    I love how kind your heart is. I love how sweet and caring you are without even
    trying. I love your cute side, your playful silliness, and even your childish
    moments — because they make you *you*, and you are perfect that way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some days may be tiring. Some days may feel heavy. But please remember that you
    never have to face anything alone. I’m always here for you — cheering you on,
    supporting you, and loving you with everything I have.
  </p>

  <div class="heart">💖💖💖</div>

  <p>
    No matter how busy the day gets, no matter what happens, my feelings for you
    don’t change. I choose you every single day. I’m proud of you. I admire you.
    And I love you more than words can ever fully explain.
  </p>

  <p>
    So take this message as a warm hug, a gentle kiss on your forehead, and a soft
    whisper saying: “You’re doing great, my love. Keep going.”
  </p>

  <div class="signature">
    Always yours,<br>
    ❤️
